		\section*{Javascript}
		A JavaScript developer is responsible for implementing the front-end logic that defines the behavior of the visual elements of a web application. A JavaScript developer is also responsible for connecting this with the services that reside on the back-end. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic. JavaScript developers often work alongside other front-end web developers who specialize in markup and styling.

		C\# is a modern, general purpose, object-oriented programming language designed around the Common Language Infrastructure. A great C\# developer is capable of handling many aspects of developing an application, including but not limited to performance, scalability, security, testing, and more. C\# developers can develop modern applications that run on desktop computers, or even sophisticated back-end processes powering modern web applications. The frameworks .Net and Mono combined allow a wide range of platforms to be targeted by applications developed with C\#.
