						<p><a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/threads/e-meglio-sarebbe-meglio.505105/">It's better you do something</a></p>
						<p>At this point, some students ask why they should be required to convince anyone of anything. "After all," they say, "we are all entitled to our opinions, so all we should have to do is express them clearly. Here's my opinion. Take it or leave it." This point of view both misunderstands the nature of argument and ignores its greatest value.</p>
						<p>To better help us understand events and their lifestyle, let's frame all of this in the context of a simple example. Here is some HTML we'll refer to:</p>
						<p>Jim built his granddaughter a sandcastle on the beach.</p>
						<p>A recent trend I’ve noticed among designers is ditching WordPress for simpler CMS solutions like Ghost, Kirby, Statamic and Jekyll.</p>
						<p>WordPress is a great CMS but for a lot of sites it can be complete overkill.</p>
						<p>Most sites simply do not need all of the functionality WordPress offers and the bloat and complexity of the software can start to get in the way.</p>
						<ul><li>get in the way = essere un ostacolo</li></ul>
						<p>This is where flat-file (also known as file-based) content management systems come into the picture…</p>
						<p>For as long as flat-file CMS's pride themselves on not using a database, they will never be able to provide the feature set provided by those that do.</p>
						<p>There is just no way (around it)</p>
						<ul><li>non c'è modo</li></ul>
						<p>As far as my friends and I were concerned, if you didn’t fit any of the other roles I mentioned, you were an OJ or “Ordinary Joker.”</p>
						<p>So this weekend was the perfect occasion to learn about all the concepts and possibilities that the indie web group is working on for more than four years now.</p>

						<p>The person is cheating on someone for you, which makes you feel more desirable than being with someone who has nothing to lose by being with you.</p>
						<p>I’m trying to figure out how to make this microphone work better.</p>
						<p>Also, yes, you could say "here is your card." That's a good point. Hotel keys aren't used much anymore. Thanks!</p>
