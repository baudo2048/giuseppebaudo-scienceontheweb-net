					<h3>ASP.NET</h3>
					<p>ASP.NET is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework. To build ASP.NET pages, you need to take advantage of the features of .NET Framework, which consists of two parts: the Framework Class Library and the Common Language Runtime.</p>

					<h3>ASP.NET Controls</h3>
					<p>ASP.NET controls are the heart of ASP.NET Framework. An ASP.NET control is a .NET class that executes on the server and renders certain content to the browser.</p>

					<h3>Framework Class Library</h3>
					<p>The .NET Framework contains thousands of classes that you can use when building an application. Framework Class Library was designed to make it easier to perform the most common programming tasks.</p>

					<h3>Common Language Runtime</h3>
					<p>The CLR is responsible for executing your application code.</p>
					<p>When you write an application for .NET Framework with a language such as C# or Visual Basic .NET, your source code is never compiled directly into machine code. Instead, the C# or Visual Basic compiler converts your code into a special language named Microsoft  Intermediate Language (MSIL).</p>
					<p>MSIL looks like an object-oriented assembly language; however, unlike a typical assembly language, it is not CPU-specific. MSIL is a low-level and platform-independent language.</p>
					<p>When your application actually executes, the MSIL code is just-in-time compiled into machine code by the JITTER (the Just-In-Time compiler). Normally, your entire application is not compiled from MSIL into machine code. Instead, only the methods actually called during execution are compiled.</p>
					<p>In reality, .NET Framework understands only one language: MSIL. However, you can write applications using languages such as Visual Basic .NET and C# for .NET Framework because .NET Framework includes compilers for these languages that enable you to compile your code into MSIL.</p>

					<h3>Assemblies</h3>
					<p>An assembly is the actual .dll file on your hard drive in which the classes in.NET Framework are stored.</p>
