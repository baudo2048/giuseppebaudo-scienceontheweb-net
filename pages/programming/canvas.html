<pre>
The HTML5 2D context (the CanvasRenderingContext2D object), retrieved by a call to
the getContext() method of the Canvas object, is where all the action takes place. The
CanvasRenderingContext2D contains all the methods and properties we need to draw
onto the canvas. The CanvasRenderingContext2D (or context, as we will call it hereafter)
uses a Cartesian coordinate system with 0,0 at the upper left and corner of the canvas,
and coordinates increasing in value to the left and down.
</pre>

<pre>
However, all of these properties and methods are used in conjunction with current
state, a concept that must be grasped before you can really understand how to work
with HTML5 Canvas. The current state is actually a stack of drawing states that apply
globally to the entire canvas. You will manipulate these states when drawing on the
canvas. These states include:

Transformation matrix
	Methods for scale, rotate, transform, and translate

Clipping region
	Created with the clip() method

Properties of the context
	Properties include strokeStyle , fillStyle , globalAlpha , lineWidth , lineCap , line
	Join , miterLimit , shadowOffsetX , shadowOffsetY , shadowBlur , shadowColor , global
	CompositeOperation , font , textAlign , and textBaseline .

Donâ€™t worry; these should not look familiar to you just yet. We will discuss these prop-
erties in depth in the next three chapters.

<h3>Immediate mode vs Retained mode</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
The canvas is an immediate mode drawing surface, which means everything
needs to be redrawn every time something changes. There are some advantages to this;
for example, global properties make it very easy to apply effects to the entire screen.
Once you get your head around it, the act of redrawing the screen every time there is
an update makes the process of drawing to the canvas straightforward and simple.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
On the other hand, retained mode is when a set of objects is stored by a drawing surface
and manipulated with a display list. Flash and Silverlight work in this mode. Retained
mode can be very useful for creating applications that rely on multiple objects with
their own independent states. Many of the same applications that could make full use
of the canvas (games, activities, animations) are often easier to code with a retained
mode drawing surface, especially for beginners.
</p>

<h3>Encapsulating your JavaScript code for Canvas</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
	Now that we have created a way to test to see whether the HTML page has loaded, we
can start creating our JavaScript application. Because JavaScript runs in an HTML page,
it could be running with other JavaScript applications and code simultaneously. Usu-
ally, this does not cause any problems. However, there is a chance that your code might
have variables or functions that conflict with other JavaScript code on the HTML page.
Canvas applications are a bit different from other apps that run in the web browser.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
Because Canvas executes its display in a defined region of the screen, its functionality
is most likely self-contained, so it should not interfere with the rest of the page, and
vice versa. You might also want to put multiple Canvas apps on the same page, so there
must be some kind of separation of JavaScript when defining the code.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
To avoid this issue, you can encapsulate your variables and functions by placing them
inside another function. Functions in JavaScript are objects themselves, and objects in
JavaScript can have both properties and methods. By placing a function inside another
function, you are making the second function local in scope to the first function.
