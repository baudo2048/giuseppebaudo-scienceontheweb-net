<h1>The Axiom of Extension</h1>
<p class="justified" contenteditable="true">
	A pack of wolves, a bunch of grapes, or a flock of pigeons are all examples of sets of things. The mathematical concept of a set can be used as the foundation for all known mathematics. The purpose of this little book is to develop the basic properties of sets. Incidentally, to avoid terminological monotony, we shall sometimes say <i>collection</i> instead of <i>set</i>. The word "class" is also used in this context, but there is a slight danger in doing so. The reason is that in some approaches to set theory "class" has a special technical meaning. We shall have occasion to refer to this again a little later. <span><a href="#">[..7] | copy</a></span>

	One thing that the development will not include is a definition of sets. The situation is analogous to the familiar axiomatic approach to elementary geometry. That approach does not offer a definition of points and lines; instead it describes what it is that one can do with those objects. The semi-axiomatic point of view adopted here assumes that the reader has the ordinary, human, intuitive (and frequently erroneous) understanding of what sets are; the purpose of the exposition is to delineate some of the many things that one can correctly do with them. <span><a href="#">more(7)</a></span>
